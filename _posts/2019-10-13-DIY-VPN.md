title: DIY VPN
---

In a previous [post](/2019/10/11/SOCKS-proxying.html), I talk about using a SOCKS proxy while you're on coffee shop Wi-Fi to hide the ultimate destination of your traffic from prying eyes. Another option that I mention, and one that might be more familiar, is using a VPN. VPNs are used for a variety of purposes; companies use them to allow their employees to remotely access internal office networks. I decided to setup and run my own VPN as a way to learn more about them.

Fortunately, existing tools like [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) and [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) make this a lot easier than it would be otherwise. They also add layers of abstraction so we don't have to know, for example, the nuts-and-bolts of public-key cryptography to run our VPN. This knowledge is still helpful, and one objective of this post is to pull away a layer of abstraction or two so we can arrive at a better understanding. Actually running your own VPN involves a fair amount of work, some of which can be automated. The result of this effort was [diy-vpn](https://github.com/zbo14/diy-vpn), an ongoing project that houses bash scripts, config files, and other miscellany that will hopefully make the process of running your own VPN even easier.
