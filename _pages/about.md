Hi, my name's Zach! I'm a backend software engineer and novice bug bounty hunter interested in web application security and computer networking. I enjoy hands-on development, pet projects, pets, coffee and beer as the bookends to my day.

I'm currently looking for ~opportunities~ so if you're hiring or just want to connect, feel free to drop me a line at zmbalder<<at>>gmail<<dot>>com.
