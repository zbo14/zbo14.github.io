Hi, my name's Zach! I'm a software engineer (and occasional bug-bounty hunter) interested in web applications and computer networking. I enjoy hands-on development, pet projects, pets, coffee and beer as the bookends to my day. Currently working at [Gatherly](https://www.gatherly.io/) and [we're hiring!](https://gatherly.breezy.hr/)
