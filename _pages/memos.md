# Memos
I like to play keyboard and sing sometimes. I've tried my hand at recording with GarageBand but the path of less resistance (albeit lower quality) has been recording voice memos on my phone. Here are some that I felt like sharing...

**PSA:** you probably need to bump the volume to hear vocals.
