# Website <a href="https://github.com/zbo14/zbo14.github.io"><svg class="svg-icon" style="vertical-align:middle"><use xlink:href="{{ '/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#github' | relative_url }}"></use></svg></a>

I decided to make this site with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so I could update it by pushing changes to a repository. This is convenient since I'm already using GitHub and I'm familiar with the workflow. GitHub Pages uses a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and I think the integration is pretty nice.
