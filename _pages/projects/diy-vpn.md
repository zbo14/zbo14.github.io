I decided to setup and run my own VPN as a way to learn more about them. Fortunately, existing tools like [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) and [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) make this a lot easier than it would be otherwise. Still, running your own VPN involves a fair amount of work, some of which can be automated. This project houses bash scripts, config files, and other miscellany that hopefully makes the process of running your own VPN even easier.
