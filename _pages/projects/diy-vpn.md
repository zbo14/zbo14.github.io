I wanted to setup and run my own VPN. Existing tools like [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/), [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa), and [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) make this a lot easier than it would be otherwise. Running your own VPN still involves a fair amount of work, some of which can be automated. This project houses bash scripts, config files, and other miscellany that hopefully make the process of running your own VPN a little easier.

I talk more about DIY VPNs [here](/2019/11/07/DIY-VPN-With-WireGuard.html)!
