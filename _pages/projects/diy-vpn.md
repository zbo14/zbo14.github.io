I wanted to setup and run my own VPN. Existing tools like [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) and [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) make this a lot easier than it would be otherwise. Running your own VPN still involves a fair amount of work, some of which can be automated. This project houses bash scripts, config files, and other miscellany that hopefully make the process of running your own VPN even easier.
