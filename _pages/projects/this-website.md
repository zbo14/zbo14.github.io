# This website <a href="https://github.com/zbo14/zbo14.github.io"><svg class="svg-icon" style="vertical-align:middle"><use xlink:href="{{ '/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#github' | relative_url }}"></use></svg></a>

I made this site with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I update it pushing changes to a Github repository, which is convenient since I'm already using Github at work/on side projects and I'm familiar with the workflow. Github Pages uses a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This is the first time I've used it but the integration with Github Pages is super nice.
