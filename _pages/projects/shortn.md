I was asked to create a URL shortener as part of an interview process. This project was the result, and I had a lot of fun with it! I set a personal goal of designing a distributed application. As I thought through a solution, the difficulties and tradeoffs with designing a distributed URL shortening service became more apparent. I highlight these points in [a design doc](https://github.com/zbo14/shortn/blob/master/design.md). I wanted to explain why I made certain decisions and why the infrastructure was the way that it was. Putting my thoughts in a markdown file was really helpful! It forced me to better understand my own thought process. This affected my engineering decisions; I ended up revisiting/modifying code as a result.
